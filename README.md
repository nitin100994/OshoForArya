## How to Listen (For You, Pooja)

These OSHO audios are not lectures —  
They’re **soul whispers**. They’re mirrors.  
You don’t “study” them. You *soak* in them.

### Listen without pressure. No time slots. No goals.

- While doing daily chores — cooking, cleaning, getting ready.
- In a cab or metro — plug in a single ear.
- During a slow walk — let it drift.
- While eating — just keep the volume gentle.
- While bathing — play it like background music.
- Before sleep — low volume. ASMR. One earphone. Pillow mode.

---

### Things to know:
- Each audio is **1 to 2 hours** long.
- You’re not supposed to understand it all at once.
- Don’t make notes. Don’t try to *"get it."*
- Let it play on loop for weeks, even months.
- Every time you listen, **you’ll catch something new**.
- Even if it feels boring at first — *give it a few minutes*. Your mind will shift.

### What I can promise you:

This is **not boring**.  
These are not “gyan” lectures.  
They are **stories**, **comedy**, **wild jokes**, and **truth bombs**.  
OSHO teaches by *making you laugh, pause, and wonder.*  
Once you start, you won’t want to stop.

This is planned for you.  
And I believe the **time is right now**.

---

### Most important:
Start with **just one goal**:  
**Use these audios to fall asleep.**  
That’s all.  

Let them become your **night companions**.  
With time, your mind, body, and soul will align naturally — no force, no control.

> *You don’t need to believe what OSHO says.  
> Just listen. Just witness.  
> Your feminine energy knows what’s real — better than logic ever will.*  

Let these words fall on you like rain.  
Some droplets will sink. That’s enough.
